Be Inpsired.  I am.  Everyday.,"My heroes are are people who inspire me with their everyday strength, caring and positive drive, no matter their circumstances. People who treat everyone with equal respect. This is why I teamed with Chris Calabro for the 2018 Run for Refugees. Chris is an incredible, positive force and always works to find a way to achieve good, to be inclusive of all. This is also why I work with refugees and with my colleagues at IRIS. In refugees and the staff at IRIS I have found daily, undeniable goodness and inspiration. A force and will to do the right thing by every person. Chris will be running IN the race for our team, while my IRIS colleagues and I take charge of the race. However, let's be clear, we are doing this for the most vulnerable in the world refugees.

Natitlan and Sametenango Experience Guatemala Challenge,"Sam and Natalia met in December 2016 at La Iguana Perdida in Santa Cruz, Lake Atitlan. They fell in love instantly with each other and the lake and a year later they are still there! They work and live at La Iguana Perdida, a hotel, hostel, restaurant/bar and diving school. La Iguana was started by Dave and Deedle, which like Sam and Nat, met each other at La Iguana 21 years ago. Their love for the lake is apparent in all the work that they do for the community, neighbouring villages and the lake itself. Sam and Natalia run a weekly class up in CECAP in Santa Cruz teaching the culinary students customer service. Niños de Guatemala reached out to Sam and Nat to be a part of their Experience Guatemala Challenge and as soon as they heard the news they immediately accepted it. Niños de Guatemala provides quality education to Guatemalan children from low income families. They have built two primary schools and a secondary school which serve a total of 500 students, their families and communities. They also provide their students with two meals a day plus medical and dental care. In addition to this, they also give their students and their families access to psychology and social work programs and host workshops on important issues. These are only a few of the things that they have done to empower and support these children, there is so much more that Niños de Guatemala have done for their students it is breathtaking. Sam and Nat are super excited to raise money and be in this once of a lifetime experience. Click the donate button to help them raise money for this worthy cause. ",$300,"$5,000",7,8days,2018-02-16

Surgical Mission to Bangladesh ,"All throughout my training I had dreamed of going on a medical mission. I suppose I wanted to feel like I was making a difference. That dream finally became a reality in 2015. That was the year that I had the fortune to cross paths with a trauma surgeon who I work with and who is also the founder of the International Surgical Health Initiative. That mission was truly a wonderful experience where I got to go to Africa for the first time, meet the generous people of Ghana, and practice my skill in providing them with the much needed surgical care. Since then I have gone with ISHI to Peru and this year am getting involved on the mission to Bangladesh. Not only is Bangladesh the third least developed country in the world, according to the UN, but it now has also been hit with a refugee crisis as a result of the Rohingya persecution in Myanmar. Needless to say medical care is severely lacking and we hope to be able to contribute to the ongoing humanitarian effort by operating for one week in the Chittagong region. Hence, please consider making a contribution to this fantastic organization which has already gone on numerous missions around the world and will continue providing medical relief to some of the neediest people on the planet.","$2,001","$2,000",17,26days,2018-02-16

Sexually Abused Children's Relief Endeavor,"  Raising $5000 will help about 2 families provide food, housing, transportation, counseling, utilities and other necessities for families impacted financially by the reporting of child sexual abuse. When an income provider is the abuser and that income disappears, the family faces an immediate financial crisis. It takes about 60-90 days before they can find support through other agencies. sacred's support is immediate. within 24 hours, the family's child advocate has a check in hand to pay for the family's immediate needs for the first 30-60 days after reporting. This year, sacred has helped 35 families with grants in excess of $70,000. The only limitation we have is how much money we can raise. The more we raise the more families we can help. Since no one is compensated at sacred, the majority of donations go directly to families in need. We need your support as families in need continue to seek our help. The physical nightmare for the child and the family ends when the crime is reported but the emotional nightmare goes on for years. Won't you help us ease the pain in those early days after reporting that their child has been sexually abused?  ","$3,350","$5,000",3,3months,2018-02-16

I'm Running the L.A. Marathon for Food & Water Action!,"  Our planet's in big trouble and I want to do something about it, one step at a time. Avoiding the worst of the climate crisis won't be easy, so I'm taking lots of steps....26.2 miles worth. I'm running the Los Angeles Marathon on March 18 to raise money for Food & Water Action's campaign to move Off Fossil Fuels Now!  
 And because a marathon is 26.2 miles, I'm attempting to raise $2620. I hope you will consider supporting me.
 Why running? If you had told me three years ago I was going to run a marathon I'd have thought you were nuts. I hadn't run at all since high school. But then my kids started cross country in 6th grade, and I couldn't let those little guys be faster than me, so I started running (I'm still faster than them but they're getting close).  
 Training for this marathon is a lot of work! Most of my runs start around 5:00-5:30 am. I get these in before the family wakes up. It is really peaceful out and gives me a chance to think about the day ahead. I run 5 days a week and I think my training will peak around 45 miles/week.  
 Running may sound like a lot of work, but the real work that needs to be done is in moving us off fossil fuels. I've been blessed to work at Food & Water Watch for nearly 10 years. During that time, our incredible team has banned fracking in New York, Maryland, and communities across the country, stopped pipelines and export facilities, and blocked some reall terrible industry backed bills.  
 This year our politcal arm - Food & Water Action - is working to elect climate champions at the state and federal level - people who will not only go toe to toe with Trump and climate deniers, bold also push for bold solutions that will actually address the problem.  
 We only have a limited amount of time to prevent the worst impcats of climate change - and many are already happening. What is the world going to be like when my kids Steven and Max and their friends are adults, let alone their children and future generations? I worry about this every day - and it's why I work at Food & Water Action and why I'm using this marathon to raise money to support this work. I hope you'll join me!  ","$2,160","$2,600",24,21days,2018-02-16

When I think of child poverty or any other suffering that a child or an adult could go through it breaks my heart! To be hopeless, vulnerable, powerless, voiceless…should not be a way of living. We should all have an opportunity to live life. As humans we all deserve to be equipped with the tools that will help us survive. When we take care of our children and teach them kindness and love we are doing more than that, we are teaching them how to be good global citizens. They are the future generation, and we need to plant seeds of hope, joy, happiness, love and many other positive attributes. The campaign is very dear to me because I have spent a good amount of years working as a nanny with children of different ages. In addition, I grew up in Zimbabwe, and there was a good amount of street kids (meaning homeless children), and it always put me in tears to know that there are kids forced to be adults. This campaign is small, but I hope the little we can do together as a team of kid heroes and advocates for kids will help raise awareness and relieve as many kids from poverty and bad environments.

Help Ben get to Ghana!,"Hello everyone! For anyone reading this who may not know me, my name is Ben Willows and I am a student at the University of Colorado Boulder studying Environmental Engineering. This summer, I will be traveling to the rural Northern Region of Ghana for three weeks as a part of the Saha Global Leadership Program! It is truly an honor to be accepted into this program, and I am thrilled to be a part of something much larger than myself. Saha Global is a nonprofit organization that implements clean water and solar power systems in rural villages across the world. Saha is responsible for 110 clean water businesses and 28 solar power businesses worldwide, most of which are lifelines for these communities. Saha is unique in their efforts in that the clean drinking water business in Ghana that I will help build and implement will be operated by local female entrepreneurs from the village! Chances are if you're reading this you have been fortunate enough, as I have, to always have a clean glass of water to drink, whenever you'd like. However, for billions of people worldwide, this is not the case. In the Northern Region of Ghana, 40% of the population does not have access to clean water. For lack of any other option, they are forced to drink fecally contaminated water to survive. This is why I was compelled to apply for this opportunity to help, something as fundamental to life as drinking water is something that no one should live without. I am seeking funding for this project to be able to provide water treatment materials, training, and support for these female entrepreneurs to implement these businesses and maintain them for decades, to ensure that everyone in their village will never drink contaminated water again. For more information about Saha, and where I will fit in as a Water Field Representative in Ghana this May, I invite you to please visit their website at sahaglobal.org. Thank you for your time in reading this! This has been a dream of mine for a very long time to help those who need it most, and I will not be able to fulfill it without your help. Any donation amount will help tremendously, and every last cent will go toward getting these good people the clean water that they need so badly. Please contact me at any time for any more information that I can provide at willows.benjamin@gmail.com Thank you! - Ben","$1,170","$3,500",19,26days,2018-02-16

Matt’s Mission Trip to Nicaragua!,"This year I have decided to take a big leap into the real world. As of January I have officially bought my ticket to the country of Nicaragua! There I will join a group from Bermuda on a medical mission trip! Even though I bought my ticket for April 7th there is still a heavy fee left to pay! First let me explain what this trip is and what I’ll be doing in this third world country. Corner of love is a non-profit organization that has teams from all over the world fly down for a week and serve in the villages Nicaragua. This week is dedicated to hosting clinics in the town of San Ramon and small villiages found in the mountains or disconnected from the main cities. These towns normally do not have access to clean water, medical care, or even a small convenience store. The clinic brings medication, clothing, and support to wherever they are hosted. The Nicaraguans that come to these clinics get to consult with a real RN and get the medications they need, but normally don’t have access too. This trip for me is going to be a new experience and I am exicted to partake in this wonderful opportunity to serve in this third world country!! The $1,250 pays for two med kits that Fly down with me, food, and housing fee. In these kits are medical supplies, clothing, and toiletries that are used in the clinics. Its a pricey fee for a well worthy cause. I am excited to share my journey once I return home, but in the mean time would appreciate any support!",$425,"$1,250",6,11days,2018-02-16

Take 5 minutes out of your day to donate anything from 1$ to 100$ and change someone's life.
