Eradication of Invasive Mussels in Open Water - Stage 1,"The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is seeking innovative solutions to eradicate invasive zebra and quagga mussels from large reservoirs, lakes, and rivers in a cost effective and environmentally sound manner. Invasive mussel infestations pose significant logistical and economic challenges for local communities, recreationists, and water managers. Currently, no practical methods exist for large-scale eradication of invasive dreissenid mussel populations once they become widely established in a reservoir, lake, or river (referred to as “open water”). Solutions can be novel treatments or approaches that build upon existing treatments. This Challenge launches Stage 1 of a planned three-stage Grand Challenge that includes laboratory-scale and field-scale demonstrations.","$100,000 USD",169,Dec 14 2017,Feb 28 2018 23:59 EST
 Colorado River Basin Data Visualization Challenge," The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), the Seeker for this Challenge, plays a significant role in managing the Colorado River.  Reclamation relies on a broad range of Colorado River Basin (CRB) data to support short-term water management and long-term planning, including data on historical, current, and projected weather and climate conditions, reservoir storage and releases, streamflows, and diversions.  Reclamation is currently working to make CRB data more easily accessible to both Reclamation staff and non-Reclamation users such as other Federal, State, and local agencies, water users, recreationists, researchers, and other stakeholders","$60,000 USD",254,Sep 07 2017,Under Eval
Great Lakes Invasive Carp Challenge – Stage 1,The State of Michigan has appropriated 1 million dollars for a Challenge seeking to prevent the movement of invasive carp species into Lake Michigan from the Illinois River through the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS).

Sub-Seasonal Climate Forecast Rodeo,"Skillful sub-seasonal weather and climate forecasting has proven to be particularly difficult but is of great interest to water managers. Sub-seasonal forecasting, spanning approximately 15 to 45 days in the future, is difficult because it bridges short-term forecasting, where initial conditions primarily determine upcoming weather, and long-term forecasting in which slowly varying factors such as sea surface temperatures and soil moisture become more important.",See details,250,Dec 20 2016,May 03 2018 23:59 EDT
Novel Intrinsic Biocontainment Methods,"Research using viral pathogens is vital to understanding and combating illnesses caused by such viruses and preventing future worldwide pandemics. This research is not without risks and although research facilities that handle dangerous pathogens utilize the most advanced containment equipment and procedures there is still a risk of inadvertent release of such pathogens. Intrinsic biocontainment describes various approaches to deliberately modify a pathogen, and/or a host cell, so that the pathogen does not pose a significant disease risk to humans but retains normal pathological function under specific controlled circumstances. The Seeker is soliciting ideas for novel biocontainment methods that could be used to mitigate the risks associated with research on viral pathogens.","$30,000 USD",68,Feb 08 2018,Apr 09 2018 23:59 EDT

Servier Challenge: Looking for Partners to Explore Novel Opportunities in Neurodegenerative Diseases,"Servier, a middle size international pharmaceutical company based in France,  is looking for partners to find and develop novel, early-stage opportunities – ranging from exploratory projects with validated targets to lead optimization – in the area of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. The goal is to establish mid to long-term collaborations in which Servier offers scientific inputs, technological help and financial support for co-development of the innovative projects.",varies,166,Nov 20 2017,Under Eval
Non-Animal Assay to Predict Mammalian Developmental Toxicity,"The Seeker, a leading global research & development company, is seeking a partner to engage in a close partnership aimed at developing a battery of several possibly successive non-animal based assays. The goal is to accelerate the establishment of a developmental toxicity screening cascade for candidate chemicals while maintaining acceptable reliability and good predictability compared to results obtained in rodent and non-rodent models.",varies,100,Nov 02 2017,Under Eval
 Grunenthal Challenge: Restoring the Normal Function of Neurons After Intoxication by Tetrodotoxin (Fugu fish) or Similar Neurotoxins," Fugu is a well-known Asian delicacy fish, equally famous for its poisonous potential and need to be prepared by trained chefs. The neurotoxin that is present in some of the fish organs binds to the sodium channels in neurons, disrupting its function, and triggering a reaction that leads to muscle paralysis and respiratory block. ","$25,000 USD",103,Sep 27 2017,Under Eval
 Minimally Invasive Methods for Sampling Microbiome from Hair Follicles," The importance of disease-associated microorganism in skin health has long been reported and there is a growing interest in performing metagenomics studies to further the knowledge in this field. Reliable and reproducible non-invasive methods have been developed to collect surface skin microbiome. However, analyses of non-superficial layers microbiome (i.e. hair follicle, sebaceous gland) has been slowed down by the absence of a reliable and reproducible noninvasive (or, at least, minimally invasive) sampling method to collect samples of biological material. ","$15,000 USD",151,Sep 15 2017,Under Eval
""," Nearly 3 million people in the United States and 65 million people worldwide have epilepsy, a neurological condition which affects the nervous system and causes seizures. One in 26 people will develop epilepsy at some point in their lifetime, with 150,000 new cases annually in the United States. Nearly 80% of the people with epilepsy live in low- and middle-income countries and three-quarters of these individuals do not get the treatment they need.","$1,000,000 USD",239,Aug 08 2016,Oct 10 2020 23:59 EDT

GC3 Challenge: Developing New Preservatives for Personal Care & Household Products,"Preservatives are substances that are added to products to prevent them from spoiling. These chemicals work by retarding microbial growth and preventing product degradation. In addition to being used in foods, preservatives are added to household and personal care products. Due to concerns about the safety of some preservatives that have been in wide use, and the impact of repeated contact with these chemicals on human health, the Seekers desire new and effective preservatives or preservative boosters with improved environmental health and safety profiles for use in personal care and household products.","$175,000 USD",208,Apr 24 2017,Under Eval
 Wildland Fire Sensors," The solution is a field-ready prototype system that includes one central data receiving unit and at least two sensor nodes measuring fine particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and carbon dioxide (CO2) that communicates data wirelessly and measures a wide dynamic range of concentration levels expected during wildland fires. The prototype system should be accurate, lightweight, and easy to operate, enabling first responders, states and nearby communities to easily measure wildland fire smoke exposure. In addition to the potential award, all Solvers providing prototypes will directly receive information on their system’s laboratory test results as well as qualitative feedback by air monitoring experts. If the system proves to be reliable and useful, deployment of a larger-scale sensor network is anticipated as part of follow-up projects measuring smoke impacts during wild and prescribed fires. This is a Reduction-to-Practice Challenge that requires delivery of a written preview of the solution, followed by a prototype system with supporting documentation.","$60,000 USD",352,Apr 06 2017,Under Eval
