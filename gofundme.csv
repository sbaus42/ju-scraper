Mr. Dittmar's Classroom,"(With due apologies in advance for my verboseness.)My name is Andrew Dittmar, and I am exactly one week into my commitment as a Teach for America corps member. As a part of TFA, I am teaching high school English in Shaw, Mississippi, a small, predominantly rural town some one hundred miles south of Memphis, TN.Over the past week, I've met and started to get to know my students. This semester my students are a rowdy group of ninth grade spitfires. They are artists, musicians, and athletes. They are future leaders. They are absolutely hilarious. And, for the most part, they have accepted the quirks that come with having a first-time teacher with humor and grace. Cases in point: thus far I have lost a contact lens in front of them, faceplanted in front of them, dropped untold numbers of things in front of them, and taught an entire class with my shirt sticking out of the fly of my pants. When I had a booger coming out of my nose, they told me to blow it. When I tried to rap, they laughed.Most of these students have not had anything near the kind fo educational experience I have had. The district I teach in has very high teacher turnover. Classes that I was able to participate in - even some of the essentials like social studies, let alone electives - have been dropped in favor of further emphasis on tested subjects. Their reading levels are all over the place - from many years below grade level to handful that are several years above level.As an English teacher, I have a tremendous responsibility: I want to share with them the stories of the world, and simultaneously equip them with the ability to share their own stories. Even in the last week, they have shared incredible things with me. It is my hope and prayer to give them the best education possible.Shaw is situated squarely within the Mississippi Delta, which is a tremendously unique part of the United States. It's often remarkable to me that bustling metropolises just hours away - places like Nashville and Dallas - exist within the same country as the Mississippi Delta. As I said previously, it's largely rural - this is some of the most fertile farming land in the United States. It is also an area where poverty, amongst other vices, thrives. A 2014 CNN report noted that ""some of America's most brutal, entrenched poverty and racism thrives here."" Just ten miles up the road lies the Cleveland, Mississippi school district - the district that ignited national headlines a few months ago after courts ordered the town to desegregate its schools, 62 years after Brown versus Board of Education. (I did my TFA Institute experience in that district this summer.) All of this is in addition to Mississippi education system's nationwide rankings as one of the poorest-performing and poorest-funded states in the country.It's really easy to get lost in that data. It's also really dangerous, because it completely ignores so much. It ignores the beautiful sunrises I get to see every morning. It ignores the remarkable friendliness of vritually every person you meet. It ignores the fact that the area I'm teaching in truly feels like a family - I've only been a teaching staff member for a week but I've been blown away with everyone's support.But mostly it ignores the potential in these students. Even when they are acting up, these students want to learn. They want to have remarkable educational opportunities. They want to push their teachers to discuss challenging issues in new ways. They don't take their education for granted, at least not in the same way a privileged person like me was able to when I was growing up.Every teacher wants to give their students the world. I'm really excited for this year. I'm honestly more excited now than I have been at any other point in the TFA application/Institute process. And I want to give my students the world.But I need help.I am seeking funds for two reasons at the moment, as I get started on my teaching adventure.#1) My classroom libraryI was extremely fortunate to inherit a remarkable classroom library for my students to use. Things like libraries and bookstores are in rather short supply in the Delta, so my ability to get books into the hands of my students is essential to their success.That said, I want to build it even further. While I want to supplement the library as a whole, I especially want to build my YA fiction selections and my nonfiction selections. I also have a lot of athletes in my classes, and not a whole lot of sports-affiliated books. A lot of funds I hope to receive will go straight to the acquisition of these books.#2) My classroomMy hope is to make my classroom as comfortable and conducive a learning environment as possible. Students at Shaw High are on block schedules of 95 or so minutes per class. The prospect of sitting in our hard, standard classroom desks sounds dreadful to me, and I know it's not the best way for students to learn. My goal is to outfit my classroom with a variety of learning spaces where students can read and explore both independently and in groups. I have lots of kinesthetic learners in my classes... I need to harness that if I want to see growth.I am seeking the acquisition of a handful of CD players for students to listen to books on CD. I have all levels of reading in my classes, and I want my students to experience books on a wide level of media.I am also seeking general school supplies - pens, pencils, paper, the essentials.Any donation, great or small, is extremely appreciated.On behalf of myself and my students, thank you in advance for your partnership on this educational journey!
(note: donors will be graced with thank you notes from both myself and students. Quite likely many of them.)

Stevensville Montana Skate Park,"With your help we can create a Skate Park for our youth in Stevensville, Montana. It's not only for us. It's for all communities around us who will benefit also. At this time our community has no place to skate safely. The youth need a place to Skateboard, Roller Blade and Wheelchair. We have approval from our Town Council for the location.  We now need to raise the funds.
We are a small rural community in Montana. This will help many in our community with a place to create bonds, build confidence and gain life lessons.  We are working with the Stevensville Civic Club, Montana Skatepark Association, Jeff Ament, Bill Watkins along with many other's.With better recreation we create a better community.

Westpoint Park and Playground ,"The Charlotte County Recreation Association (CCRA) is in the process of raising funds for our outdoor basketball court and park facility that will be located on Westpoint Stevens Rd in Drakes Branch,Va. Property has been purchased for the project but more funds will be needed for development and equipment.We have provided youth basketball in Charlotte County for the past 13 years.Our organization currently relies on our public school facilities for games and practices and other activities, however there are times when these facilities are not available.This project will allow us to further our activities during Summer months.It will also allow us to incorporate activities for older teens that are aged out of the present basketball league.This facility will be closely monitored and strictly controlled.We currently offer basketball programs for youth ages 7-14 yrs old. However, because of limited gym facilities we are unable to expand the age groups.We would also like to add playground equipment to the site. All this is needed to help our youth combat boredom and offer a wholesome activity to steer them clear of trouble.Your assistance will be greatly appreciated as we cannot succeed without public help. We are not County affiliated as we are a 501 c 3 non profit organization. Our County does not have an official County operated recreation association.This can be your way to help build a better community.

Sha-Mel-Lon Recreation Center ,"We are a neighborhood pool that is in desperate need of not only repairs but a complete overhaul! Sha-Mel-Lon is a 40 year old pool that has been a place to build memories and have fun for the community. Countless families have poured into the facility over the years in either membership or joining the summer swim team and would love to see it thrive again! Our dream is to add two more lanes to the pool (to make it a six lane pool) - which would require an overhaul on the pump system, update the basketball courts, and add a playground / picnic area.  As well as making sure we stay on top of current bills.We are also wanting to support our community by giving swim lessons to those less privileged. Please share this with your family, friends, and strangers. #shamellon

Random Acts of Tattoo Project,"Update:Great news - Southside Tattoo is thrilled to share that GoFundMe Studios found our story and created a documentary about Shane Johnson, a man we covered tattoos for. Please take a moment to watch it below so you can see more deeply into the Random Acts of Tattoo Project. We appreciate your sharing this video and this campaign - we hope to keep raising funds so we can continue to play a part in incredible stories of transformation like Shane's. Thank you sincerely!

Original story:What started as a small gesture to help our community went world wide! Our goal was to help ex gang members in Baltimore cover their gang and racist tattoos so that they could get rid of the constant reminder of a past life. We have gotten hundreds of inquiries about work, some near, some far. We want to help as many people as possible, but know there are costs for supplies and travel. Our goal is to form a non profit collective of artists from all over the world and get people the services that they need for free! We have had an overwhelming request asking where donations could be made. We are truly humbled to have the ability to heal others through our art... no strings attached. What are donations used for?The time and materials it takes to do cover up tattoos are generously donated by each participating tattoo artist, but there are some tattoos that can't/shouldn't be covered up (facial tattoos for example), and this is where donations come in. Here's a breakdown of costs to help people in this category:$150-$500: We partner with local tattoo removal services all over the country, and this amount pays for one session of laser tattoo removal for someone wanting a fresh start.$100,000: This amount would pay for a laser removal machine. We'd love to buy one of our own and will continue fundraising for it!Every penny is appreciated. ○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○○Thanks for spreading the love ♡ Sometimes people make bad choices, and sometimes people change. We, at Southside Tattoo would like to make a difference. If you, or someone you know has a tattoo that is GANG or RACIST related, and you want it covered... WE WILL COVER IT FOR FREE. No questions asked. We believe that there is enough hate in this world and we want to make a difference. Please call the shop and set up a consultation with any of our artists. SPREAD LOVE NOT HATE ♡ PLEASE SHARE this campaign with family and friends:  https://www.gofundme.com/39i3m68 #eternalink #tatsoul #rinsecup #electrasyn #becritical #lifeisshortdostuffthatmatters

Cookies for Mila,"★  ALL DONATIONS WILL BE MATCHED THROUGH 12/20!! Donate $50 and $100 will be donated to Mila... it's magic! ★ *The deadline to pay for a life-saving treatment for Mila is DECEMBER 20 (ONLY 7 DAYS AWAY). *See? $1 = $2 until December 20! 
Hi, I’m Dana and I’m 7 years old.  I am raising money to help save the life of my friend, Mila. About two years ago, I had to go to speech therapy, and when I was there, I met a girl named Mila. We became good friends because we both had a stutter. We worked really hard at therapy. After a year, I got better and my stutter went away. But Mila’s didn’t. Mila kept getting worse. I found out a few months ago that Mila was diagnosed with a rare disease called Batten. It’s a problem with her genes. She was born with it, and if she doesn’t get treatment, she will get super sick and then she will die. I feel heartbroken for Mila and her family, especially her little brother, Azlan. He is almost the same age as my brother, Carson. I imagine how sad Carson would be if I got sick and was going to die.The  good news is that there is a new treatment for Mila that could stop her disease and SAVE HER LIFE!  And the research will help save the lives of lots of other kids who are sick like Mila. But it’s experimental so insurance won’t cover it and it is SUPER expensive.I really want to save my friend. I asked my mom how I could help and she said we could bake cookies. So, we baked a bunch of cookies, loaded them and my brother in a red wagon, and sold the cookies all over our neighborhood.  We started in the summer, and since then, we have sold so many cookies! We even started shipping cookies across the country because so many people want to help Mila. My first goal was $1000 and we hit that right before Halloween. I was so excited, but Mila still needs more help to afford her treatment. I’m starting this GoFundMe so that I can reach more people. I want to inspire kids all over the world to join me by raising money (lemonade stands, bake sales, GoFundMes) to help save Mila's life with me!!(That's Mila  ^)Can you help me save my friend? Any size donation will help. Thank you and please help us spread the word.All funds raised will be withdrawn by Mila's family.Here is Mila's family's campaign:   https://www.gofundme.com/savingmilaYou can learn more about Mila here:
